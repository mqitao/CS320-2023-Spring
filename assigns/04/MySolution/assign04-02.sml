The function [list_subsets]
returns all the subsets of a given
set (where sets are represented as lists)
//
fun
list_subsets
(xs: 'a list): 'a list list =
(
case xs of
  nil => [[]]
| x1 :: xs =>
  let
    val res = list_subsets(xs)
  in
    res @ list_map(res, fn(xs) => x1 :: xs)
  end
)
//
Please give a NON-RECURSIVE implementation of
list_subsets based on list-combinators. Note that
the order of the elements in a list representation
of a set is insignificant.
